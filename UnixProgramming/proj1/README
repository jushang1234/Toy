PURPOSE:

make4061 is a simple version of GNU Make that makes project building more convenient, efficient and controllable. The purpose of the make utility is to  determine automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to recompile them. 

SYNOPSIS: 

make4061 [-f makefile] [options] ... [target]

OPTIONS:
	
	No options
		make 4061 will use "Makefile" as default makefile name and build the first target in the makefile. If target is found, build the target. Only single target is allowed.

	-f <filename>
		Use filename as a makefile
	-m <logname>
		Store the log from make4061 in <logname>. If <logname> does not exist it will be created.
	-n
		Only display the commands to be executed but won't actually execute them. Without -n switch commands will be both displayed and executed.
	-B
		Force recompile every target.

COMPILE:

	gcc -o make4061 main.c util.c -std=c99
	OR
	make

EXAMPLE USAGE:

	./make4061
	Build the first target in file "Makefile".

	./make4061 ex_target
	Build ex_target in file "Makefile".

	./make4061 -f ex_makefile ex_target
	Build ex_target in file "ex_makefile".

	./make4061 -f ex_makefile -n
	Display the commands for building the first target in "ex_makefile" but don't actually execute them.

	./make4061 -f ex_makefile -n -m ex_log.log -B ex_target
	Store the commands for building ex_target in file "ex_makefile" in "ex_log.log" but don't actually execute them.
